        <h1>Sally Field</h1>
        1965–1976
        Field with Joanne Woodward in Sybil (1976)
        <br>
        Field got her start on television as the boy-crazy surfer girl in the sitcom Gidget (1965–1966). The show was
        not an initial success and was canceled after a single season; however, summer reruns garnered respectable
        ratings, making the show a belated success. Wanting to find a new starring vehicle for Field, ABC next produced
        The Flying Nun with Field cast as Sister Bertrille for three seasons, from 1967 to 1970. In an interview
        included on the Season One DVD release, Field said that she thoroughly enjoyed Gidget, but hated The Flying
        Nun because she was not treated with respect by the show's directors. Field was then typecast, finding respectable
        roles difficult to come by. In 1971, Field starred in the ABC TV movie Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring, playing a
        discouraged teen runaway who returns home with a bearded, drug-abusing hippie (played by David Carradine).
        She made several guest television appearances through the mid 1970s, including a role on the western Alias Smith
        and Jones, a popular TV series starring Gidget co-star Pete Duel. She also appeared in the episode "Whisper"
        on the TV thriller Night Gallery.
        <br>
        In 1973, Field was cast in a starring role opposite John Davidson in the short-lived series The Girl with
        Something Extra from 1973 to 1974. Following the series' cancellation, Field studied at the Actors Studio
        with the acting teacher Lee Strasberg. Strasberg became a mentor to the actress, helping her to move past her
        television image of the girl next door. It was during this time period that Field divorced her first husband
        in 1975.
        <br>
        Soon after studying with Strasberg, Field landed the title role in the 1976 TV film Sybil,
        based on the book by Flora Rheta Schreiber. Her dramatic portrayal of a young woman afflicted
        with multiple personality disorder earned her a best dramatic actress Emmy Award in 1977 and
        enabled her to break through the typecasting of her sitcom work.
